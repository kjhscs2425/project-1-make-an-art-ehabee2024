# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
My drawing will look like a mirror with a reflection

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
One variable could be the distance 
One variable could be the size

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
There is repetition in the different codes


4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
The main part is the mirror itself. Im deciding if there should be a clear section or a object in between the two mirrors

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
One way I could use a loop variable is when I type the program to draw the big mirror. I plan on using the same codes for the first mirror on the second one with minor changes
